# Majesik: World

Majesik: World is an evolving rebrand of the open-source multiplayer voxel RPG derived from Veloren.
The project is transitioning toward a new identity and feature set; this README holds placeholders while the game takes shape.

## Project Status

- ⚠️ Active rebranding in progress
- ✨ Feature list and world lore are being drafted

## Building

This repository uses Rust nightly and tracks large binary assets with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/).
Before building, ensure Git LFS is installed:

```bash
git lfs install
cargo build
```

More detailed build notes will be added as systems migrate from the original Veloren codebase.

## Contributing

Contributions of code, art, design, and testing are welcome.
Please review [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for workflow guidelines.

## Community

Community channels (Discord, forums, etc.) will be announced as the rebrand progresses.
For now, GitHub issues and pull requests are the best way to get involved.

## License

The project continues under the terms of the [GNU GPLv3](LICENSE).
Assets may carry additional licenses noted in their respective directories.
